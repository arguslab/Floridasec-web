## Call for Participation

This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners in 
security-related fields across Florida and the neighboring area. 
The goal of this workshop is to provide a regular forum for presenting 
research and education activities in all areas related to computer and 
communication security, as well as promoting interactions and 
collaborations among scholars and students and between academia 
and industry. 

The first Florida Security workshop will be hosted by 
[University of South Florida](http://www.usf.edu/)
on **Dec 8, 2016**. It will be a one-day workshop which includes
a keynote speech and presentations. There will be no printed 
proceedings. We would like to invite researchers, engineers, educators, 
and students to join us in the first event of the series. Registration 
information will be available on the [workshop website](http://floridasec.arguslab.org/).
